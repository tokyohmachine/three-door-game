The game consists of three doors: Door 1, Door 2, and Door 3. One of the doors contains a prize, while the other two doors contain ChoreBots. 
The player must click on a door to reveal what is behind it. If the prize is revealed, the player wins the game. If a ChoreBot is revealed, the game ends and the player loses.
At the start of each round, the doors are reset to their closed state. The player must then choose a door to reveal what is behind it. After each choice, one of the remaining doors is revealed to be a ChoreBot. The player must continue to choose doors until the prize is revealed or a ChoreBot is chosen.
If the player wins the game, they are given the option to play again. If the player loses the game, they are given the option to try again.

# Implementation
The Chore Door game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game consists of three images representing the doors, a button to start the game, and a score display. 
The game logic is implemented using JavaScript, which handles the door clicks, door reveals, and game state.


## Credits
The Chore Door game was created as a project for the Codecademy Web Development curriculum.
